# An Overview of Biometric Abuses

Almost everyone has dealt with biometric data at some point, whether it's for authentication on your phone, or taking a photo for your driver's license, any time you're using data derived from your body to be identified it's biometrics.

There's nothing inherently wrong with biometric authentication, in fact it's one of the pillars of secure [multi-factor authentication](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/Multi_Factor_Authentication): something you know, something you have, and **something you are**. Plenty of systems use biometrics in a private way. Your phone, for example, stores your biometric data safely inside its [secure element](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/biometric-security-sec067eb0c9e/1/web/1); it never leaves your device and can't easily be extracted. This is one of the most important aspects of ethical biometrics: the data should never be stored on a server somewhere or accessible to anyone, even you.

But many biometric systems in place today aren't designed to preserve your privacy and simply exist to track you around.

## Surveillance Systems

Plenty of organizations want to be able to track you around for a multitude of reasons, from governments to grocery stores. Unfortunately, your human body has plenty of unique signatures that can identify you individually.
